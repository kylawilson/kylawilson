I am currently a second-semester junior at Boston University studying Computer Engineering. 

I am particularly interested in hardware and low-level software.

Some of my favorite classes I've taken are Computer Organization, Computer Architecture, and Introduction to Embedded Systems.

I program in C, C++, Verilog, and Python.
